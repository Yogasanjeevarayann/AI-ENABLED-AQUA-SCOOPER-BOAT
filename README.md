# AI-ENABLED-AQUA-SCOOPER-BOAT
Our project aims to tackle the issue of water pollution in aquatic environments by introducing an AI-enabled Aqua Scooper Boat that utilizes advanced image processing techniques. Our solution combines the power of deep learning and computer vision to detect and remove debris from water bodies, thereby restoring the natural habitat of aquatic life.

The Aqua Scooper Boat is equipped with state-of-the-art image processing algorithms based on YOLOv7, a popular object detection system. The system is trained to recognize and locate various types of debris such as plastic waste, bottles, and cans, among others. Once detected, the system uses a robotic arm to collect the debris and store it in a designated container on the boat.

Our Aqua Scooper Boat is designed to operate autonomously, thanks to its advanced software and hardware components. The boat's navigation system is equipped with GPS and sensors that allow it to navigate through water bodies while avoiding obstacles. Moreover, the boat's batteries can be charged using solar panels, making it an eco-friendly and sustainable solution.

Our project has the potential to make a significant impact on the environment by removing harmful pollutants from water bodies, thereby preserving the natural habitat of aquatic life. With the rising concern of water pollution, we believe that our project is a step towards a cleaner and healthier future
