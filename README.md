Plastic pollution is a widespread problem affecting the marine environment . It
threatens ocean health , the health of marine species, food safety and quality ,
human health , coastal tourism , and contributes to climate change . The most
visible impacts of plastic debris are the ingestion , suffocation and entanglement of
hundreds of marine species . Marine wildlife such as seabirds , whales , fish and
turtles mistake plastic waste for prey ; most then die of starvation as their stomachs
become filled with plastic . They also suffer from lacerations , infections, reduced
ability to swim , and internal injuries . Floating plastics also help transport invasive
marine species , thereby threatening marine biodiversity. In order to overcome the
issues , we have designed an Autonomous Surface Vehicles ( ASV ) that detects
objects floatable plastic wastes in water surface using a Machine Learning ( ML )
Algorithm and collect them by using the conveyor belts . This surface vehicle will
first detect the objects that are already programmed and gives the command to the
controller . The above mentioned process is done by On Board Computer ( OBC )
and many sensors such as LIDAR , GPS , Camera Modules are also interconnected
with OBC . The entire process is done by the OBC and each command is given to
the controller . The ASV returns to the home whenever the tub is filled or it doesn't
detect any waste to be collected . By this ASV , we can reduce the plastics in the
water bodies and hence the marine animals are benefited by this which in turn
saves the marine ecosystem.
